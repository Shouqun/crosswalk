# Source folder for xwalk core reflection related java targets.
## Why it's empty
The source codes for reflection are generated at build time.
The gyp system still needs a java_in_dir to work.
So there is no java src here.
## Why put me here
To make git keep the folder, the src directory is needed to
build an apk.
